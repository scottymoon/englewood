					Our Beliefs

				<ul class="list-unstyled">
					<li>
						<h3 class="mg-md">
							The Scriptures
						</h3>
						<p>
							The scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are the inspired Word of God (II Timothy 3:16), presenting to us the complete revelation of His will for the Salvation of men, and constituting the Divine and only rule of Christian faith and practice (II Peter 1:21).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 class="mg-md">
							The Godhead
						</h3>
						<p>
							Our God is a trinity in unity, one God manifested in three persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. God is infinitely perfect, being in His three persons co-existent, co-equal, and co-eternal. God the Father is greater than all (John 14:28); the source of the Word (LOGOS) and the Begetter (John 16:28; John 1:14).<br /><br />The Son was begotten of the Father, accepting earthly limitations, true God and true man; conceived by the Holy Ghost and born of the Virgin Mary. He died upon the Cross, the Just for the unjust as a substitute sacrifice, and all who believe in Him, are justified on the grounds of His shed blood. According to the Scriptures, He arose from the dead. He is now at the right hand of the Majesty on High as our great High Priest. He will return again to establish His Kingdom of righteousness and justice.<br /><br />The Holy Spirit is a Divine Person, Executive of the Godhead on earth, the Comforter, sent by the Lord Jesus Christ to indwell, to guide, and to teach the believer, and to convince the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 class="mg-md">
							Man, His Fall, and Redemption
						</h3>
						<p>
							Man is a created being, made in the likeness and the image of God, but through Adam&rsquo;s transgression and fall, sin came into the world (Romans 5:12). “All have sinned and come short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). “As it is written, there is none righteous, no not one” (Romans 3:10). Jesus Christ, the Son of God was manifested to undo the work of the devil and gave His life and shed His blood to redeem and restore all men back to God (John 3:18). Salvation is the gift of God to man, separate from works and the Law, and is made operative by grace through faith in Jesus Christ, producing works acceptable to God (Ephesians 2:8).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 class="mg-md">
							Salvation
						</h3>
						<p>
							Salvation is made possible through the meritorious work of Jesus Christ on the cross and through Holy Spirit conviction. Godly sorrow works repentance and makes possible the experience of the new birth. What Christ formed within us is the gift of eternal life (Titus 2:11; Romans 10:13-15; Luke 24:47, Titus 3:5-7). Church – The true Church is the body of Jesus Christ (Colossians 1:18; Ephesians 4:15), He being the Head. Its earthly constituents are all true believers, born again by the Spirit (John 3:6) and by the Word (I Peter 1:23). To it is delegated the various gifts and offices of the Holy Spirit (I Corinthians 12:7-11, I Corinthians 12:27-28), necessary for the successful fulfillment of Christ&rsquo;s Great Commission to the Church, as given to the disciples in Matthew 28:19 and Mark 16:15-20.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 class="mg-md">
							Ministry
						</h3>
						<p>
							God, through the Holy Spirit, definitely calls such as He desires to serve as evangelists, pastors and teachers, and specifically endues the one called with the talents and gifts peculiar to that office or offices (Ephesians 4:11-13). Under no circumstances, should anyone be ordained or set apart to any such office unless the calling is distinct and evident.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 class="mg-md">
							Water Baptism
						</h3>
						<p>
							Baptism in water by immersion is a direct commandment of our Lord (Matthew 28:19) and is for believers only. The ordinance is a symbol of the Christian&rsquo;s identification with Christ in His death, burial and resurrection (Romans 6:4, Colossians 2:12, Acts 8:36-39). The following recommendation regarding the Water Baptismal formula is adapted, to wit: “On the confession of your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and by His authority, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.” Baptism of the Holy Ghost – The Baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire (Matthew 3:11), is a gift from God, as promised by the Lord Jesus Christ to all believers, and is received subsequent to the new birth (John 14:16-17, Acts 1:8; 2:4; 38-39; 1-:44-48). The Baptism of the Holy Spirit is accompanied by various Spiritual gifts, often with speaking in tongues as the initial physical evidence (Acts 2:4).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 class="mg-md">
							Sanctification
						</h3>
						<p>
							The Bible teaches that without holiness no man can see the Lord (Hebrews 12:14). We believe in the doctrine of sanctification as a definite, yet progressive, work of grace, commencing at the time of regeneration and continuing until the consummation of salvation (Hebrews 13:12; II Thessalonians 2:13; I Peter 1:2; Ephesians 5:26; I Corinthians 6:11; John 17:17; I Thessalonians 5:23).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 class="mg-md">
							The Lord&rsquo;s Supper
						</h3>
						<p>
							The ordinance of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is a commandment of our Savior; and being a memorial to His death and resurrection, is strictly limited to Christian believers (I Corinthians 11:27). Its time and frequency of observance are left to the discretion of each Congregation (I Corinthians 11:26).Only unfermented grape juice, the fruit of the vine, as recommended by our Lord (Matthew 26:29; Mark 14:22; Luke 22:18) shall be used in connection therewith.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 class="mg-md">
							Divine Healing
						</h3>
						<p>
							Healing is for the physical ills of the human body and is wrought by the power of God, through the prayer of faith, and by the laying on of hands (Mark 16:18; James 5:14-15); it is provided for in the atonement of Christ, and is available to all who truly believe.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 class="mg-md">
							Resurrection of the Just
						</h3>
						<p>
							The Bible promises, “This same Jesus shall so come in like manner” (Acts 1:11). His coming is imminent; when He comes, “The dead in Christ shall rise first; then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air” (I Thessalonians 4:16-17). Following the tribulation, He shall return to earth, as King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and together with His Saints, who shall be kings and priests, He shall reign a thousand years (Revelation 20:6).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 class="mg-md">
							The Coming of the Lord
						</h3>
						<p>
							We hold to the belief of the imminent coming of the Lord as the blessed hope of the Church.Whereas, the teaching that the Church must go through the tribulation tends to bring confusion and division among saints; therefore, we recommend that all our ministers teach the imminent coming of Christ, warning all men to be prepared for that coming, which many occur at any time; and not lull their minds into insecurity by any teaching that would cause them to feel that certain events must occur before the rapture of the Church.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 class="mg-md">
							Hell and Eternal Retribution
						</h3>
						<p>
							The one who physically dies in his sins, without Christ, is hopelessly and eternally lost in the lake of fire, and therefore has no further opportunity of hearing the Gospel or for repentance (Hebrews 9:27). The lake of fire is literal (Revelation 19:20). The terms “eternal” and “everlasting” used in describing the duration of the punishment of the damned (Matthew 25:41-46) in the lake of fire, carry the same thought and meaning of endless existence, as used in denoting the duration of joy and ecstasy of saints in the presence of God.
